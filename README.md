## Installation

First, download the project and:

```sh
cd simple-flask-API
```

Check if you have python and pip installed in your computer. Then you have to create a virtual environment to run flask.
```sh
pip install flask
py -m venv venv
```
Then:

```sh
flask run
```

## Usage example

This is just a slim and simple template that can be used as a starter to your flask project. Any changes can be made as you wish. This is a simple application so that any other flask API can grow from. So, if you want an API that returns static data back, it's a great starter. Or, if you would like to add a database, it can be easily done in this template.
